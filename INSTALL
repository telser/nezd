==================================


Edit config.mk to match your local setup (nezd is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install nezd (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Optionally if you want to use nezd's gadgets:

    cd gadgets
    make clean install


Note:       By default nezd will not be compiled with Xinerama and XPM support.
            Uncomment the respective lines in config.mk to change this.


Use "./help" to view a nicely formated version of the documentation.
